The Reduced Instruction Set Computer [RISC]
processor is a computer arithmetic-logical unit that
has a small set of instructions that optimizes the entire
logic in most frequently used instructions which can
be quickly accessible for faster execution. Compared
to CISC and RISC processors software must handle a
greater number of operations per cycle. The RISC
processors have a trump card in entreaty that will be
helpful to perform faster instruction execution. The
process of designing, testing, and manufacturing
them is also relatively inexpensive. The instruction
register became very complex to design and the
control unit occupies most of the chip area the
instructions that access memory results in decreasing
the speed execution. Thus, the RISC processor is
developed, and a small set of instructions results in
simplifies the design and improves the overall
performance of the processor
